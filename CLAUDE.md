# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a comprehensive security presentation called "Vibeâ€‘Coded App Security" - a fast, practical playbook for non-dev builders shipping AI-backed apps. It's a single-page interactive presentation with 15+ slides and live security demonstrations, designed for 15-25 minute talks.

## Development

### Running the Project
- Open `index.html` directly in a browser (most features work)
- For full functionality and testing interactive demos, use a local server:
  ```bash
  python3 -m http.server 8001
  # or
  npx serve
  ```

### Project Structure
- `index.html` - Main presentation with all security content and interactive demos
- `scripts/main.js` - Navigation, scroll handling, and UI interactions
- `scripts/slide-modules.js` - Modular interactive demonstrations for each security topic
- `styles/main.css` - Comprehensive styling with color themes and responsive design

## Key Features

### Navigation System
- Smooth scroll-snap between 15+ slides
- Keyboard navigation (J/K, arrows, space, Home/End)
- Timeline progress indicator with interactive dots for each slide
- Auto-hiding UI that appears on interaction

### Interactive Security Demonstrations

#### Frontend vs Backend Demo (`frontend-backend`)
- DevTools button bypass demonstration
- Shows why server-side validation is critical
- Interactive examples of client-side security failures

#### XSS Protection Demo (`xss-demo`)
- Live XSS payload testing (safe environment)
- Secure vs insecure rendering comparison
- Sample payloads for demonstration

#### RLS (Row Level Security) Testing (`rls`, `rls-testing`)
- Multi-user access control simulation
- A/B user testing interface
- 3-step RLS verification process

#### Secrets Management Scanner (`secrets`)
- Real-time code scanning for potential secrets
- Pattern matching for API keys, tokens, passwords
- Sample vulnerable code for demonstration

#### Rate Limiting Demo (`api-limits`)
- Interactive API request simulation
- Rate limit enforcement visualization
- Request flooding demonstration

#### File Upload Validation (`storage`)
- MIME type and size validation
- Security extension checking
- Real-time file analysis

#### SSRF Protection Demo (`server-calls`)
- URL allowlist/blocklist testing
- Private IP range detection
- Sample dangerous URLs for testing

#### Security Headers Inspector (`cors-headers`)
- Current page header analysis
- Security header recommendations
- CSP and CORS configuration examples

## Modular Demo System

The `slide-modules.js` file contains individual demo initializers:
- `initFrontendBackendDemo()` - DevTools bypass demo
- `initSecretsDemo()` - Code scanning for secrets
- `initRLSDemo()` - User access control testing
- `initXSSDemo()` - XSS protection demonstration
- `initRateLimitDemo()` - API rate limiting simulation
- `initHeadersDemo()` - Security headers inspection
- `initUploadDemo()` - File upload validation
- `initSSRFDemo()` - SSRF protection testing
- `initRLSTestingDemo()` - Automated RLS testing

Each demo is self-contained and can be modified independently.

## Styling System

### Color Themes
Each slide has a unique color theme via `data-color` attribute:
- `blue` - Introduction, API limits, checklist
- `red` - Mindset, vulnerability classes  
- `violet` - Frontend/backend, XSS, RLS testing
- `indigo` - AI prompts, storage, resources
- `orange` - Secrets, CORS/headers
- `teal` - RLS, server calls
- `green` - Keep current

### Interactive Elements
- Consistent button styling (danger vs safe actions)
- Result panels with color-coded status (success/error/warning)
- Tabbed interfaces for multi-user scenarios
- Code blocks with monospace fonts
- Sample payload buttons for quick testing

## Important Considerations

### Security Focus
This is an educational security demonstration app:
- All "vulnerable" code is contained and safe for demonstration
- Clear visual distinction between secure and insecure examples
- Speaker notes provided for presentation context
- Real security patterns demonstrated in safe environment

### No Build Process
Intentionally simple architecture:
- Native ES modules for JavaScript
- CSS custom properties for theming
- No dependencies or build tools required
- Everything runs directly in modern browsers

### Presentation Optimized
- Light-mode only for projection visibility
- High contrast colors and large text
- Keyboard navigation for presentation flow
- Auto-hiding timeline for clean slides during presentation
