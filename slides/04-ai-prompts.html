    <h3>ðŸŽ¯ Give Context First</h3>
    <p><strong>Ramble!</strong> Explain your app, users, tech stack, concerns. More context = better security advice.</p>

    <ul class="security-criteria">
      <li><strong>Input checking:</strong> What could users send that would break things?</li>
      <li><strong>Who sees what:</strong> How do I make sure users only see their own stuff?</li>
      <li><strong>Spam protection:</strong> How do I stop someone from spamming my app?</li>
      <li><strong>Quick test:</strong> Give me a way to verify these protections actually work</li>
