    <h3>ðŸŽ¯ Give Context First</h3>
    <p><strong>Ramble!</strong> Start with what you want to build, then keep talking about your security concerns. The more you share your worries, the better security advice you get.</p>
    <div class="example-context">
      <em>"I need a recipe sharing feature where users can upload photos and recipes. Actually, I'm using Supabase for the backend. Oh wait, I'm worried about people uploading malware disguised as images. Also, what if users can see other people's private recipes? And what if someone spams the upload endpoint? I'm not sure how to handle file validation either..."</em>

    <ul class="security-criteria">
      <li><strong>Input checking:</strong> What could users send that would break things?</li>
      <li><strong>Who sees what:</strong> How do I make sure users only see their own stuff?</li>
      <li><strong>Spam protection:</strong> How do I stop someone from spamming my app?</li>
      <li><strong>Quick test:</strong> Give me a way to verify these protections actually work</li>

    <strong>Copy-paste starter for production security:</strong><br>
    <em>"Before this goes live: Are all routes properly authenticated? Can users only access their own data? Are there rate limits to prevent spam and abuse? How do I verify that unauthorized users get rejected with proper error codes? Walk me through testing these security controls step by step."</em>
